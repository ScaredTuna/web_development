        <h3>1. Records Storage Problem</h3>
        <p>
            This project was to create a program that would have a functioning menu system which asks for user input.
            The menu needed to have options for entering records, viewing records and to exit the program. The viewing
            records option then needed a sub menu to ask what type of records to view. In all cases the program needed
            ask if the user wanted to continue with the same action once the user finishes.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Barren Moor Text Adventure</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project was to create a simple text adventure game where the player had to navigate a
            grid by entering north, east, west or south in order to find a hidden treasure. In order to guide the player
             the distance to the treasure needed to be displayed before each move. The game also includes some events
            and a monster whom the player must avoid.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Battleships Game</h3>
        <p>
            As the name implies, the Battleships project was to create a functioning game of battleships that can be
            played against another player, or a computer. This required the ability for users to place ships on a grid,
            with checks to ensure the placement was valid, and to take shots at the other players ships. The current state
            of the project contains a working menu and ship placement system, but has yet to implement the shooting
            mechanic or the computer opponent.
